# Mockfish
Chess engine written in Go !

# Details
I wanted to attempt to make a chess engine that could reliably beat humans
with advanced optimization and best known techniques for search / evaluation.

Also, I wanted it to be realtively fast (in order to search deeper), and so Go
was my chosen language. 

C++ was considered, but in order to take advantage of such optimizations, I would need to manage memory very efficiently, something for a personal project I was not interested in doing. 

*I more so wanted to explore advanced search, pruning, and bit operations in order to make a good engine.*
